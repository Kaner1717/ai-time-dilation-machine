🔮 AI Time Dilation Machine
An interactive AI tool that simulates conversations with your potential future selves based on your current habits, mindset, and goals.
Overview
The AI Time Dilation Machine allows you to speak with three different versions of your future self:

💪 Disciplined You: What happens if you stay consistent and push your limits
😐 Average You: What happens if you give some effort but stay comfortable
😔 Fallen-Off You: What happens if you give up and rationalize excuses

Through conversations with these future selves, you can gain insights, motivation, and warnings to help guide your current decisions.
How It Works

Your goals
Your current mindset

Each version represents a different potential outcome
